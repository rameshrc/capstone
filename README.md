## What ?

your goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) you encountered in this section of the program. You will use a dataset related to the marketing of bank products over the telephone.

As part of this exercise, I have examined the dataset from Portuguese banking institution, which has information about a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. Leveraging this data and by applying various classifier models, I have explored the factors that influence the decision to purchase a term deposit product.

## Objective

The objective is to to compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) to accurately predict if client will subscribe to a term deposit. By identifying customers who are likely to subcribe, we aim to proactively direct the campaigns to them through targeted marketing and thus increase campaign efficiency and reduce costs involved.
