### Detecting Credit Card Approval
**Goal/ Question:** 
Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank is able to decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant. Credit scores can objectively quantify the magnitude of risk. The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of an applicant getting credit card approval.

**Data Problem:** The data task is to train and tune data to be identify key dimensions that help build a highly accurate model that predicts the credit score and hence credit card approval rate. This will enable the credit companies to identify the risky applicants from non-risky applicants.

**Data**

The data is sourced from Kaggle.
